A couple paragraphs about the general approach you took

I made this app becasue I wanted something that me and my friends could use to store our workouts. We write a lot of our own workouts and are contstanlty using our Notes, pen and paper, excel and pictures to save all of our workouts. This usually works when we're writing them for ourselves, but when we want to share our workouts with each other things sometimes get messy and are formatted a little different. With this app we'll be able to all create our workouts in one place and it'll be easy for other to see our workouts and save them to our profile so we can use them / read them later. 

So I first wanted to be able to create a workout and have it display on the page for everyeon to see. I then want to make sure that any workout I made is easily found on my page. Then I wanted to create an easy way for me to save the workouts I liked in one place instead of having to search through all of them.

User stories – who your users are, what they want and why
    My users are people who workout and want to store and share workouts (my firends). We want a place where can keep all of our workouts so its easy to find and easy for eachother to share them.
